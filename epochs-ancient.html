                <h2>Antient art</h2>
                <p>Ancient art forms the foundation of European cultural heritage, laying the groundwork for the evolution of art throughout history. Spanning from 3000 BCE to the 5th century CE, it encompasses the cultures of Ancient Egypt, Greece, Rome, and other Mediterranean civilizations. This period is characterized by harmony, symmetry, and the pursuit of ideals of beauty and perfection.
                <br>
                This period was not just about creating objects of beauty but also about storytelling, religious devotion, and the embodiment of cultural ideals. From the intricate hieroglyphs of Egypt that detailed the lives of pharaohs and gods to the dramatic sculptures of Greece celebrating human form and achievement, ancient art served as a mirror of the societies that produced it. It reflected their values, beliefs, and aspirations while offering us a glimpse into the worldviews of the past.
                <br>
                By examining ancient art, we unlock a profound understanding of the origins of human expression and creativity. It connects us to a time when the desire to immortalize beauty, power, and spirituality first took shape in tangible form, leaving behind artifacts that remain some of the greatest treasures of human history.</div>
